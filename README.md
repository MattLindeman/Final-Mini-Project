# Final-Mini-Project

The purpose of this project is to see how well NBA player numeric data can predict a player's primary position and categorize their team role. This repository contains the csv files and the notebook file that I used to analyze the data. Both of the csv files come from the sports reference website and contain the advanced statistics numbers (adv_stats.csv) and per game numbers (per_game.csv) for each player in the 2023-24 NBA season. The (player_catergories.ipynb) notebook contains the code I used to explore and analyze the data. The notebook is organized into four main parts: loading and preparing the data, exploratory data analysis, data analysis/model building, and cluster analysis/dimension reduction. My main findings and takeaways are inlcuded in 'FMP - Report.docx', but I encourage you to look for your own insights as you explore this repository.
